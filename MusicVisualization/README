This project was developed for the Fall of 2014 Mobile Web Graphics class by Ben Lipson and Mitch Kosieramiearksaeri.

It's a music visualization application written in javascript using html and css. It uses soundJS for music analysing 
and webGL and 2D canvases for the visualizations. The usage is as follows:

-It must be run from a web server otherwise the soundJS and webGL stuff won't work.
-index.html is the homepage, just navigate to it in a browser to start the app.


The structure is as follows:


index.html stores the choice of song in the browsers local storage, then redirects to musicVis.html. musicVis gets 
the song name from the local storage, and starts the init function.

init():
	-creates the myApp object to hold all of the soundJS stuff
	-sets up the event handler to start the process
myApp object:
	-prototype:
		-holds all of the state variables for soundJS and DOM element event handling
		-init():
			-sets up soundJS
			-sets up context using javascript's built in web audio plug-in
			-creates the analyser node
			-gets the song name and calls the playSound() funciton
		-playSound():
			-connects the analyser node to the audio context
			-gets the frequency, waveform, and decibel data into three different arrays
			-plays the sound
			-handles all click/touch events for all of the DOM elements (like the media player)
canvas2D:
	-Next is all the code for the 2D visualizations. It sets up the initial visualizations, as well as the tick2D 
	function.

webGL:
	-All the webGL code for the boxes visualization. Includes initGL(), initShaders(), initBuffers(), tick(), 
	animate(), and draw().
